      <h2>About Kerala</h2>
      <p>
        Kerala, a state situated on the tropical Malabar Coast of southwestern
        India, is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the country.
        Named as one of the ten paradises of the world by National Geographic
        Traveler,[1] Kerala is famous especially for its ecotourism initiatives
        and beautiful backwaters.[2] Kerala has unique culture and traditions
        coupled with its varied demography. Several international agencies
        ranging from UNESCO to National Geographic have recognised the state's
        tourism potential.[3] Kerala was named by TIME magazine in 2022 among
        the 50 extraordinary destinations to explore in its list of the World's
        Greatest Places.[4] In 2023, Kerala was listed at the 13th spot in The
        New York Times' annual list of places to visit and was the only tourist
        destination listed from India.[5]

        <h3><li>Alappuzha</li></h3>
        <p>
          Referred to as the Venice of the East, Alappuzha has always enjoyed an
          important place in the maritime history of Kerala. Today, it is famous
          for its boat races, backwater holidays, beaches, marine products and
          coir industry. Alappuzha Beach is a popular picnic spot. The pier,
          which extends out to the sea here, is over 137 years old.
          Entertainment facilities at the Vijaya Beach Park add to the
          attraction of the beach. There is also an old lighthouse nearby which
          greatly intrigues all visitors.   Another delightful experience while
          in Alappuzha is the houseboat cruise. The houseboats you find in the
          backwaters of Alappuzha are in fact a reworked version of the
          Kettuvallams of olden times. Kettuvallam is a Malayalam word, ‘Kettu’,
          refers to dwelling structures and ‘Vallom’ means boat. In the olden
          days, kettuvallam or boat with thatched roof that covers over wooden
          hulls was used to carry tons of rice and spices.
